## Project Context and Outcomes
This project focuses on cleaning and visualizing the Titanic dataset using Python. The dataset is analyzed for missing values, normalized, and categorized where necessary. Various visualization techniques are employed to explore relationships between different features, such as survival rate by gender and class, age distributions, and fare analysis. The final cleaned dataset is saved for further use.

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)
- Required Python libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib

You can install the dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash

```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd main.py
```
3. Install the required dependencies (if not already installed):
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run Instructions
To execute the script and generate visualizations, run the following command:
```sh
python tmain.py
```

This will output cleaned data and display various visualizations for analysis.

## Expected Outputs
- Cleaned Titanic dataset saved as `titanic_cleaned.csv`
- Multiple visualizations, including histograms, scatter plots, boxplots, pie charts, and heatmaps
